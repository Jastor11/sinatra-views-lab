# Sinatra Views Lab

## Objectives

1. Respond to HTTP Requests with Sinatra Routes.
2. Render ERB from a Sinatra Action.

## Overview

This lesson practices creating ERB views and rendering them from a Sinatra Action in response to an HTTP request. Fork and clone this repository and run `bundle install` to get started!

## Instructions

For each of the following examples, create a .erb file in the `views` directory and a route in `app.rb` which renders that template. Make sure each template contains the requested content.

Run `shotgun` to start a local server so that you can test your app in your browser.

You can run `rspec` to get the tests passing and see errors.

1. Create a template called `hello.erb` in `views` that contains an `h1` tag with the content `Hello World`. This should get rendered via a GET `/hello` route by your `App` controller in `app.rb`.

2. Create another template called `goodbye.erb` in `views` that contains an `h1` tag with the content `Goodbye`. This should get rendered via a GET `/goodbye` route by your `App` controller in `app.rb`.

3. Create two templates in `views` - `dogs.erb` and `cats.erb`. Both are rendered via GET `/dogs` and `/cats`, respectively. Make sure that `dogs.erb` contains the text `Dogs are Great!` and `cats.erb` contains the text `Cats are Great, Too!`

4. Create a template called `music.erb` in `views` that gets rendered via GET `/music`. It should contain an `h1` with the content `Music` and an unordered list (`ul`) of some of your favorite music, artists, or genres within `<li>`s. The `views/music.erb` template should contain HTML that would render something similar in structure to:

```
Music

· Future Islands - Seasons (Waiting for you)
· Chemical Brothers - Hey Boy, Hey Girl
· Neutral Milk Hotel - In an Aeroplane Over the Sea
```
